# Observations:
#
# Creating the video reader does not immediately cause memory to increase.
# As soon as a frame is read, memory will start increasing extremely quickly.
# If frames are continuously read, memory will be kept in check.
# Whenever seek is called, memory will drop back down.
# It does not seem to matter if seek is called with 0 or a random index.
# After frame reading ends, a single seek is enough to keep memory down - it is not needed periodically.
#
# By default, it can read an uncompressed drone video at 350Hz (sequential) or 55Hz (random).
# With periodic resets to a random index every 5 seconds, the rates are the same.
# With periodic resets to a random index every 2 seconds, the rates are 340Hz/52Hz.
# With periodic resets to a random index every 1 seconds, the rates are 340Hz/52Hz.
# With periodic resets to a random index every 0.5 seconds, the rates are 345Hz/55Hz.
# With periodic resets to a random index every 0.1 seconds, the rates are 330Hz/55Hz.
# With seeking after every frame retrieval, the rates are 60Hz/45Hz.
# With an initial seek after 0.5 second, memory usage got to about 0.8GB.
# With an initial seek after 1 second, memory usage got to about 1GB.
# With an initial seek after 2 second, memory usage got to about 3.2GB.
#
# So the paradigm implemented below is to reset by seeking after frame reading ends.
#   If an application is reading frames faster than the reset interval, everything behaves normally.
#   But if there is a lull in reading frames, there will be a seek afterwards to keep memory usage low.
